# Admin Dashboard - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

This project showcases an **Admin Dashboard** for managing users, roles, and content with **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. The system enables an admin to manage users and assign roles, while creators can generate posts, and users can view and follow creators. This project is built using modern **React.js** techniques to ensure scalability and responsiveness.

## Overview

The Admin Dashboard facilitates seamless management of users, roles, and content through features like post creation, viewing, and following. It is designed to demonstrate **RBAC** concepts with protected routes, optimized user interfaces, and efficient state management.

## Features

### Admin Features  
- **Role Management**: Assign or toggle user roles between `user` and `creator`.  
- **User Management**: Add, remove, or edit users.  

### Creator Features  
- **Post Management**: Create, edit, and delete posts using a rich text editor.  
- **Post History**: Access and manage previously published posts.  

### User Features  
- **Post Viewing**: Browse and read posts created by creators.  
- **Follow Creators**: Follow or unfollow specific creators to personalize content.  

### Shared Features  
- **Protected Routes**: Pages are restricted based on user roles for security.  
- **Optimized UI**: Shimmer loading effects for data fetching and debounced inputs for smoother interactions.  
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional across devices with a toggleable sidebar for mobile.  

---

## Technologies Used  

- **React.js**: Building reusable and interactive UI components.  
- **React Router**: Managing navigation and implementing protected routes.  
- **Context API**: For global state management of user roles, posts, and authentication.  
- **Reducer**: Centralizing state updates for roles and content.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling components and achieving a responsive design.  
- **TinyMCE**: Enabling creators to write and edit posts with a rich text editor.  
- **Debounce**: Enhancing input efficiency by limiting frequent API calls.

## State Management  

### Context API  
- Centralized global states for authentication, roles, and posts to eliminate prop drilling.  

### Reducer  
- Handles complex state transitions like toggling roles, managing users, and creating posts.

## Routing & Permissions  

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  

| **Role**  | **Access**                             |  
|-----------|---------------------------------------|  
| **Admin** | Manage users, assign roles, add posts. |  
| **Creator** | Create, edit, and manage posts.       |  
| **User**   | View posts and follow creators.        |  

- **Protected Routes**: Unauthorized users are redirected to an "Unauthorized Access" page.  

---

## Authentication  

### Default Credentials  

Use these pre-configured accounts to test login functionalities:  

| **Email**             | **Password** | **Role**    |  
|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|  
| admin@example.com     | admin123     | Admin       |  
| user@example.com      | user123      | User        |  
| creator@example.com   | creator123   | Creator     |
